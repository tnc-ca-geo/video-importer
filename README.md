## video-importer
Traverses directories to import video as segmented events with correct timestamps and metadata. Details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NoluaMS6brmOC9INlg2Ah9K9xM-aQcsoa-fe3x9WxDs/edit#)

### What is it
The importer is an Open Source project to automate the ingestion of video files so that they can be labeled by advanced classifiers
running either locally or in the cloud.

### Who is it for
The Importer is for all Electronic Monitoring (EM) services that record video for fisheries observation to report scientific and
regulatory data quickly.

### Why is it needed
The review and labeling of recorded video is slow. In fact, the elapsed time to review is often longer than the fishing trip's duration.
Until boats at-sea have the compute power and bandwidth sufficient to analyze, extract and upload data in real-time, the video review must
start with the on-shore processing of hard drives filled with recorded video. 

The importer makes it fast and simple to create labeled video bookmarks automatically so that the EM's own review tools and processes can
jump to the relevant video segments rather than wade through hours of video. For example, the reviewer can jump directly to events in
which tuna or marlin was brought on board as in [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BUWRHd_jss&feature=youtu.be)
